in the interest of not spamming lego's website, can I
just use the raw html file that I downloaded in its place?
YES YOU CAN: Make sure you download the webpage's HTML, NOT THE HTML
FROM THE 'view-source-page' PAGE!!

John notes:
build a pipeline
    send from repo to online place (like AWS) automatically so that I don't have
    to manually compile code
push to an online place
trunk based dev
kanban board w/ user stories

how Lego.com formats it's set price in html:
# get the price of the Lego set from Lego.com
# <meta property="product:price:amount" content="49.99"/>
# prices = soup.find_all("meta", property='product:price:amount')

How should I go about testing the website queries? Lego does not keep a set's info up forever.
But... they do seem to keep a set's info up for at least a few years after it is retired
(especially if it not a licensed set)

Do <pip freeze > requirements.txt> to make the requirements.txt doc

git config remote.origin.url "git@github.com:MichaelCintron/Lego-Price-Tracker.git"
