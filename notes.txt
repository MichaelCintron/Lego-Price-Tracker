in the interest of not spamming lego's website, can I
just use the raw html file that I downloaded in its place?
YES YOU CAN: Make sure you download the webpage's HTML, NOT THE HTML
FROM THE 'view-source-page' PAGE!!

might be time to start git-iffing my project and breaking the program into
serperate functions and classes so I can have a 'working' version of the program
and a testing environment. Also would like to start Agile-ing the project too

John notes:
build a pipeline
    send from repo to online place (like AWS) automatically so that I don't have
    to manually compile code
push to an online place
trunk based dev
kanban board w/ user stories

how Lego.com formats it's set price in html:
# get the price of the Lego set from Lego.com
# <meta property="product:price:amount" content="49.99"/>
# prices = soup.find_all("meta", property='product:price:amount')
